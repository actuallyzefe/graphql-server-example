# What to Improve?

## 1. Error Handling

In the current implementation, when an error occurs during the execution of a query or mutation, the error is logged to the console and `null` is returned. This could be improved by providing more informative error messages to the client. Instead of returning `null`, consider returning an error object with a message and possibly a status code. This would allow the client to handle errors more effectively.

## 2. Code Organization

The code could be better organized by separating the type definitions, resolvers, and schema into different files. This would make the code easier to maintain and understand.

## 3. Documentation

The code lacks comments, which makes it harder for others to understand. Adding comments explaining the purpose of the code and how it works would improve its readability and maintainability.
